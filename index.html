      <h1>The Ultimate Guide to Solving the Cube: Tribute</h1>

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>Have you been searching for the ultimate method for how to solve the Rubik's cube? Me too.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately you landed here, so you'll have to settle for the The Ultimate Guide to Solving the Cube: Tribute</p>
      <p>This is not the Ultimate Guide to Solving the Cube, it is just a tribute.</p>

      <h2 id="howtousethis">How to use this Guide</h2>
      <p>If you're the kind of person who just needs to jump in and try things, just skip all this boring stuff and start solving!</p>
      <p>If you're still reading this, then this section might just be for you.</p>

      <h3>Why this Guide</h3>
      <p>There are many excellent cubing tutorials on the internet, but I've encountered a lot of folks who still struggle to master the cube.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, the cube has about 43 quintillion possible positions (my next website will document each and every one of them, stay tuned!). This means no tutorial video will ever have the same scramble as you.</li>
        <li>For those who are just starting out, it is very disorienting to look at all those different colors on a video tutorial that are different than the different arrangement on your own cube.</li>
        <li>The solution of course is to create a cube with exactly one color on it. My team of scientists is striving to create this novelty in a lab environment, and early results look very promising!</li>
        <li>Lastly, written tutorials require reading, and who wants to do that?</li>
        <li>Furthermore, video tutorials require pausing and rewinding, and youtube is awful at letting you go back short amounts <ul><li>Youtube if you are listening, please stop deleting previously watched content so aggressively. Just... calm down. Keep it there for a second or two so everyone can learn the correct way to tie a knot. Or, how to solve the infinite mystery of the magic cube.</li></li></ul>
        <li>I should probably stop adding to this list before you fall asleep and drool on your keyboard.</li>
        <li>Also, this guide already has far too much writing in it, sheesh.</li>
        <li>Additionally, I said 'Lastly' four bullet points ago, what's up with that?</li>
        <li>Some jokes overstay their welcome, and you'd think they would take the hint.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The solution</h3>
      <p>The solution, of course, is to kidnap an expert cuber and have them teach you. Sign up for my email list and you will receive the names and addresses of top cubing personalities. You'll be wowing your friends with your new cubing talents in no time! You will also have a new best friend.</p>
      <p>If somehow that doesn't pan out (but it will), the next best solution is to have an interactive solution that lets you learn at your own pace and takes you step by step through each challenge on your way to ultimate victory.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately we don't have that kind of technology, so instead you'll just have to keep reading this guide.</p>

      <h3>Some notes</h3>
      <p>All kidding aside, mastering the cube takes patience and practice. Be patient with yourself, take your time. Here are some things that will happen as you learn.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will scramble your cube (our family calls this "toasting" your cube, which is when you mess up during a solve and have to start over).</li>
        <li>You will toast your cube <b>a lot.</b></li>
        <li>You will toast your cube at the last layer (when you are almost done!)</li>
        <li>You will toast your cube on a train. You will toast it in the rain. You will toast it in a box. You will toast it with a fox.</li>
        <li>You will be tempted to give up, but then, at your darkest hour, you'll reflect on your life up to this point. The trials you've faced, the challenges you've overcome. You'll take a deep breath, dig a little deeper, and become the little engine that got back on the horse and tried, tried again.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are many different methods for learning the cube. Some approaches have common "gotchas" that beginners get stuck on-- this method attempts to skip those patterns altogether in favor of algorithms that are less likely to trip you up. It also is designed to help you grow into more advanced methods if you choose to go beyond the beginner method.</p>
      <p>Good Night, and Good luck.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>Just kidding, we're just getting started:</p>

      <h3>Actually useful information</h3>
      <p>Pretty sure this section was titled 'How to use this Guide'. Whoops</p>
      <p>Alright... how to use this guide. Because every scramble is different, you can't just follow one set of exact instructions (4 gazillion positions for the cube, remember?). Instead, we will do something like this:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The guide provide a step by step approach to solve the cube.</li>
        <li>Most of the colors in the guide are turned gray to help you focus on the important stuff. So... focus on just the colors that are active.</li>
        <li>It may be distracting when you see patterns in the pieces that aren't part of the current step. Ignore those, they'll have their time to shine (just not yet).</li>
        <li>Don't worry about the pieces that are not relevant for your current step.</li>
        <li>The steps are designed to preserve the progress you made, even if they temporarily look scrambled. Trust the algorithms.</li>
        <li>Stay focused on the current step and stick to the plan as best you can.</li>
        <li>And remember that when life gives you lemons, then you've probably toasted your cube.</li>
        <li>Keep trying, you can do it!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>How to use the interactive cube</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the + button to step through the turns one at a time. Use the - button to go backwards</li>
        <li>Step through the algorithm a couple times through. Go slow, try to understand how the step is moving you toward your goal.</li>
        <li>If you get lost/stuck, STOP TURNING THE CUBE. Slow down and see if you can figure out where in the algorithm you were. If not, you've toasted your cube, congratulations! Go back as many steps as you need to get back on track.</li>
      </ul>

      </div>
      <h3>Corner Twists (watch out!)</h3>
      <p>Sometimes the corners of your cubes get twisted, causing your cube to become unsolveable. If you are doing an algorithm and you think it's correct, and everything is correct except a single corner is facing the wrong way, then try twisting it to the correct orientation and move forward.</p>

      <h2 id="daisy">Daisy</h2>
      <p>Now that you've mastered the Righty Alg, let's start solving the cube. Actually, first let's stop to smell the daisies.</p>
      <p>We will keep the yellow face (the side with the yellow center) facing up for entire solve. Of course you need to turn the cube to look at all sides, just remember to keep the yellow center on top!</p>

      <h3>The goal</h3>
      <p>All four white edges will be facing up, surrounding the yellow center.</p>

        Yellow Cross

      -->

      <h2 id="yellowcross">Yellow Cross</h2>
      <p>Follow the yellow brick road!</p>

      <h3>The goal</h3>
      <p>Use this algorithm one, two, or three times to reach the Emerald City (or to build the yellow cross).</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <div class="roofpig" data-config="base=YELLOWCROSS | setupmoves = U"></div>

      </div>


      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>There are three patterns of yellow stickers on top. The yellow Dot, the yellow V, and the yellow Line.</p>
      <p>Look at your cube to determine <b>which step you're on</b> and start there (sometimes you get to skip a step or two, what a deal!)</p>
      <p>If there is no V or Line, then it's the Dot case (even if other yellow stickers are on top but don't make one of those two shapes).</p>
      <p>Ignore extra yellow stickers, just focus on the Dot, V, and Line</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>The "Sune" Algorithm</h3>
      <p>This is a favorite alg for many cubers, enjoy!</p>
      <p>While "Sune" is technically pronounced "Soo-nay", most cubers just call it "Soon"</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>After creating the yellow cross, there are 7 different configurations you'll find yourself in. Don't panic though, because the Sune alg can handle them all!</p>
      <p>Depending on which case you have, it will take doing the Sune alg 1x, 2x, or 3x times to finish making the top yellow.</p>
      <p>Look at your cube and match it to one of the 7 cases (based on the yellow stickers).</p>
      <p><b>Important:</b> You may need to rotate the top of your cube in order to make your stickers match one of the patterns. Be sure to rotate the top to <b>exactly</b> match the case before using the Sune alg.</p></p>
      <p>After you've done your current case, check the next section for your new case until you're done.</p>

      <h3>Sune x3</h3>
      <p>If your cube looks one of these, it will take 3x Sune algs to make the top yellow (more practice, lucky you).</p>
      <p>After you perform the alg for these cases, <b>go to the Sune 2x section and look for Anti-Sune</b>, which will be the next case to solve for.</p>
